#There are four branches as follows: The DNN branch is the DNN, TL-DNN and TL-DNN-PICKING models, which are the three data-driven models before and after transfer learning; The data branch is based on the data set generated by AM,FEM and sensitivity analysis; AM branches are codes that evaluate the effects of data sets generated based on AM methods. The Sensitivity analysis branch is code for discrete sensitivity analysis and sample selection.
